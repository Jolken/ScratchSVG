Utility to import svg files into scratch 2
This is SVG repair for scratch.
When I was creating SVG for scratch in Adobe Illustrator, I've met the problem. SVG files are black after importing. The main problem is that Scratch 2 can't read "style" tag. So we need to add for every class its parameters from this tag. This utility is doing this.
